**Stack Operations**

|S.N.|Stack Operations|Task|
|----|----------------|----|
|1|push()|adds an element or an item at top of Stack.|
|2|peek()|get the top element or last added element from Stack without removing item from Stack.|
|3|pop()|removes the top item of Stack.|
|4|search()|operation search the item in a Stack and returns the location of item. if the item is not found it returns -1.|
|5|isEmpty() or empty()|checks if the Stack is empty. if empty returns : true, else returns : false|
|6|search()|clears all the items from Stack|
